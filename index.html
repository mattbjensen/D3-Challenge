          <h3 class="byline" style="text-align: center;">by MATTHEW B. JENSEN</h3>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            New links between health risks and measures of age and income have been discovered by data analysts across the United States! This breaking news summary highlights the salient facts below:
            <br><br>
            <strong>Obesity</strong>
            <br>
              - With the stongest correlation yet, obesity and median household income have a clearly visible negative correlation. To clarify, obesity rates are lower in states with a higher median household income.<br>
              - As related to poverty, a slightly positive correlation exists between states' obesity rates and the percentange of the states' population living in poverty. <br>
              - Age and Obesity do not appear to have a meaningful correlation at the state level. <br>
              </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Smoking</strong><br>
              - Smoking and poverty have a visible positive correlation. <br>
              - Regarding smoking and age, most states fall within a ten year age range for the median smoker's age. Just four states have median soker ages falling outside of ages 32 to 42 in the entire dataset. <br>
              - Similar to obesity and median household income, we see a strong negative correlation between the percentange of smokers in a state and the median household income.</p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Healthcare</strong><br>
              - Also of note, we see a strong positive correlation between the percentange of residents lacking healthcare and the percentange of residents in poverty. <br>
              - Age group seems to show no reasonable correlation, and most datapoints fall between 32 and 42. <br>
              - Though weaker than the correlations of smoking and obesity to median household income, the percentange of residents lacking healthcare still show a visible negative correlation to median household income by state.</p>
